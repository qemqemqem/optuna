# LLM Distribution Estimation: Methods and Best Practices

## Brainstorm: LLM Interaction Patterns

### Category 1: Direct Scoring/Rating Approaches

**1A. Point-wise Probability Assessment**
```
"Rate the probability (0-100) that this configuration will perform well:
{learning_rate: 0.001, batch_size: 32, dropout: 0.5}"
```

**1B. Batch Configuration Scoring** 
```
"Rate each configuration (0-100):
Config A: {lr: 0.01, batch: 16}
Config B: {lr: 0.001, batch: 32}  
Config C: {lr: 0.1, batch: 8}
Return JSON: {'A': score, 'B': score, 'C': score}"
```

**1C. Relative Ranking**
```
"Rank these 10 configurations from most likely to succeed (1) to least likely (10):
[list of configurations]"
```

**1D. Pairwise Comparisons**
```
"Which configuration is more likely to perform better?
A: {lr: 0.01, batch: 32} vs B: {lr: 0.001, batch: 64}
Respond: A, B, or EQUAL"
```

### Category 2: Generative/Sampling Approaches

**2A. Single Configuration Generation**
```
"Given this optimization context, suggest the single best hyperparameter configuration:
Context: [search space, problem type, recent results]"
```

**2B. Multiple Configuration Generation**
```
"Suggest 10 diverse, promising hyperparameter configurations for this problem:
[context]
Return as JSON array"
```

**2C. Conditional Generation**
```
"Given that learning_rate=0.001 performed well, suggest 5 related configurations 
that might also work well"
```

**2D. Temperature-Controlled Sampling**
```
"Generate configurations with varying risk levels:
- 3 conservative (likely to work)
- 4 moderate (balanced risk/reward)  
- 3 aggressive (high risk, high reward)"
```

### Category 3: Analytical/Descriptive Approaches

**3A. Distribution Parameter Estimation**
```
"For this problem type, what are typical ranges and distributions for:
- Learning rate: [mean, std, distribution_type]
- Batch size: [mean, std, distribution_type]
- Dropout: [mean, std, distribution_type]"
```

**3B. Correlation Analysis**
```
"Describe the relationships between hyperparameters for this problem:
- Which parameters should be adjusted together?
- What are the typical ratios/relationships?
- Which combinations should be avoided?"
```

**3C. Multi-Modal Description**
```
"Identify 2-3 different 'regimes' or strategies for this problem type,
with typical hyperparameter ranges for each regime"
```

### Category 4: Interactive/Iterative Approaches

**4A. Active Learning**
```
"Given these results so far, which 3 regions of hyperparameter space 
should we explore next to learn the most?"
```

**4B. Uncertainty-Guided Exploration**
```
"Where are you most uncertain about performance? Suggest configurations
to resolve this uncertainty"
```

**4C. Iterative Refinement**
```
Trial 1: "Suggest initial configurations"
Trial 2: "Given these results, refine your suggestions"
Trial 3: "Focus exploration around the promising region"
```

### Category 5: Hybrid/Meta Approaches

**5A. Strategy Selection**
```
"What optimization strategy would work best for this problem?
A) Aggressive exploration B) Conservative refinement C) Multi-modal search
Then generate configurations matching that strategy"
```

**5B. Ensemble of Methods**
```
Method 1: Generate 5 configurations
Method 2: Rate 20 random configurations  
Method 3: Describe 3 promising regions
Combine all information into distribution
```

**5C. Progressive Revelation**
```
"Start broad: What general principles apply?
Get specific: What ranges make sense?
Get precise: Suggest exact configurations"
```

### Detailed Analysis

**Point-wise Scoring (Recommended for Dense Coverage)**
```python
class PointwiseScoring:
    pros = [
        "Fine-grained probability estimates",
        "Can query any point in space", 
        "Good for filling in sparse regions",
        "Mathematically clean output"
    ]
    cons = [
        "Expensive for high coverage",
        "Potential inconsistency across calls",
        "May not capture global structure"
    ]
    
    best_for = "Dense evaluation of candidate regions"
```

**Configuration Generation (Recommended for Initial Exploration)**
```python
class ConfigurationGeneration:
    pros = [
        "Captures LLM's holistic understanding",
        "Cost-effective for initial exploration",
        "Naturally diverse if prompted well",
        "Fast to implement and test"
    ]
    cons = [
        "Sparse coverage of space",
        "Inconsistent quality across runs",
        "Requires robust parsing/validation"
    ]
    
    best_for = "Bootstrap/warm-start optimization"
```

**Parameter Estimation (Recommended for Prior Information)**
```python
class ParameterEstimation:
    pros = [
        "Captures domain knowledge systematically",
        "Provides interpretable distributions",
        "Cost-effective for continuous coverage",
        "Good for theoretical grounding"
    ]
    cons = [
        "May miss problem-specific nuances",
        "Requires sophisticated prompt engineering",
        "Hard to validate accuracy"
    ]
    
    best_for = "Building informed priors"
```

## Best Practices for LLM-Based Distribution Estimation

### 1. Prompt Engineering Principles

**Specificity and Context**
```python
def build_context_prompt(study, problem_info):
    prompt = f"""
    OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT:
    Problem: {problem_info['type']} on {problem_info['dataset']}
    Model: {problem_info['architecture']}
    
    SEARCH SPACE:
    {format_search_space(study.search_space)}
    
    CURRENT PROGRESS:
    Best performance: {study.best_value:.4f}
    Best config: {study.best_params}
    Trials completed: {len(study.trials)}
    
    RECENT FINDINGS:
    {summarize_recent_trials(study.trials[-10:])}
    
    REQUEST: [specific task]
    """
    return prompt
```

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
```
"Let me think through this step by step:
1. What type of problem is this?
2. What do we know works well for similar problems?
3. How do the recent results inform our strategy?
4. What configurations should we try next?"
```

**Multiple Perspectives**
```
"Consider this from three angles:
- Theoretical: What does optimization theory suggest?
- Empirical: What do similar papers/experiments show?
- Practical: What are common successful configurations?"
```

### 2. Consistency and Reliability

**Temperature Control**
```python
# For consistent scoring: low temperature
scoring_config = {"temperature": 0.1, "top_p": 0.9}

# For diverse generation: higher temperature  
generation_config = {"temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.95}
```

**Ensemble Consensus**
```python
def ensemble_llm_scoring(configs, n_runs=3):
    scores = []
    for run in range(n_runs):
        run_scores = llm_client.score_configs(configs, temperature=0.2)
        scores.append(run_scores)
    
    # Use median to reduce outlier impact
    final_scores = np.median(scores, axis=0)
    confidence = 1 - np.std(scores, axis=0) / np.mean(scores, axis=0)
    
    return final_scores, confidence
```

**Validation and Sanity Checks**
```python
def validate_llm_suggestions(suggestions, search_space):
    checks = {
        'in_bounds': all(is_valid(s, search_space) for s in suggestions),
        'diversity': calculate_diversity_score(suggestions),
        'reasonableness': check_typical_ranges(suggestions),
        'consistency': measure_internal_consistency(suggestions)
    }
    return checks
```

### 3. Cost-Effectiveness Strategies

**Hierarchical Querying**
```python
class HierarchicalLLMQuery:
    def estimate_distribution(self, study):
        # Level 1: Cheap broad analysis (1 call)
        strategy = self.llm.analyze_optimization_strategy(study)
        
        # Level 2: Medium cost region identification (2-3 calls)  
        promising_regions = self.llm.identify_regions(study, strategy)
        
        # Level 3: Expensive detailed scoring (10-20 calls)
        detailed_scores = {}
        for region in promising_regions:
            candidates = self.sample_region(region, n=10)
            scores = self.llm.score_batch(candidates)
            detailed_scores.update(scores)
        
        return self.build_distribution(detailed_scores)
```

**Caching and Reuse**
```python
class CachedLLMDistribution:
    def __init__(self, cache_duration_hours=24):
        self.cache = {}
        self.cache_duration = cache_duration_hours
    
    def get_distribution(self, context_hash):
        if context_hash in self.cache:
            timestamp, distribution = self.cache[context_hash]
            if time.time() - timestamp < self.cache_duration * 3600:
                return distribution
        
        # Cache miss: query LLM
        distribution = self.query_llm_distribution(context_hash)
        self.cache[context_hash] = (time.time(), distribution)
        return distribution
```

### 4. Error Handling and Robustness

**Graceful Degradation**
```python
class RobustLLMDistribution:
    def __init__(self, fallback_methods=['uniform', 'optuna_only']):
        self.fallback_methods = fallback_methods
    
    def estimate_distribution(self, study):
        try:
            return self.llm_estimate_distribution(study)
        except LLMTimeoutError:
            logger.warning("LLM timeout, using cached distribution")
            return self.get_cached_distribution(study)
        except LLMParsingError:
            logger.warning("LLM parsing failed, reducing to uniform prior")
            return self.uniform_distribution(study.search_space)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"LLM distribution estimation failed: {e}")
            return None  # Fall back to pure Optuna
```

**Output Validation**
```python
def validate_and_clean_llm_output(raw_output, search_space):
    try:
        parsed = json.loads(raw_output)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Try to extract JSON from text
        parsed = extract_json_from_text(raw_output)
    
    # Validate against search space
    cleaned = {}
    for param, value in parsed.items():
        if param in search_space:
            cleaned[param] = clamp_to_bounds(value, search_space[param])
    
    return cleaned if len(cleaned) > 0 else None
```

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Simple and Reliable
```python
class BasicLLMDistribution:
    """Start with configuration generation + validation"""
    
    def estimate(self, study, n_suggestions=10):
        # Generate configurations
        suggestions = self.llm.generate_configs(study, n=n_suggestions)
        
        # Validate and clean
        valid_suggestions = [s for s in suggestions if self.validate(s)]
        
        # Build KDE with uniform smoothing
        if len(valid_suggestions) >= 5:
            return KDEDistribution(valid_suggestions, epsilon=1e-5)
        else:
            return UniformDistribution(study.search_space)
```

### Phase 2: Add Scoring Capability
```python
class ScoringLLMDistribution(BasicLLMDistribution):
    """Add point-wise scoring for better coverage"""
    
    def estimate(self, study, n_suggestions=10, n_scoring=50):
        # Phase 1: Generate initial suggestions
        suggestions = super().estimate(study, n_suggestions)
        
        # Phase 2: Score additional points
        random_points = self.sample_search_space(n_scoring)
        scores = self.llm.score_batch(random_points)
        
        # Combine suggestions + scores into distribution
        return self.build_hybrid_distribution(suggestions, scores)
```

### Phase 3: Adaptive and Intelligent
```python
class AdaptiveLLMDistribution(ScoringLLMDistribution):
    """Adapt strategy based on optimization progress"""
    
    def estimate(self, study):
        progress = self.analyze_progress(study)
        
        if progress.stage == 'exploration':
            return self.diverse_generation_strategy(study)
        elif progress.stage == 'exploitation':  
            return self.focused_scoring_strategy(study)
        else:  # refinement
            return self.local_optimization_strategy(study)
```

## Key Insights

1. **Start Simple**: Configuration generation is most reliable for initial implementation
2. **Layer Complexity**: Add scoring, ranking, and interactive methods incrementally  
3. **Always Validate**: LLM outputs need robust parsing and bounds checking
4. **Cost Management**: Use hierarchical querying and caching aggressively
5. **Fallback Plans**: Always have non-LLM alternatives for reliability
6. **Measure Everything**: Track LLM suggestion quality to adapt over time

The sweet spot is likely **configuration generation with occasional scoring** - reliable, cost-effective, and captures LLM strengths while avoiding weaknesses.
